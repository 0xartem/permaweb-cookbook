Atomic assets are a type of digital asset that are built on blockchain technology and adhere to certain standards. The core principles of the Atomic Asset standard include:

1. Non-Fungible: Each atomic asset is unique and cannot be replaced by another asset. This means that each atomic asset has a unique identifier that sets it apart from other assets.

1. Immutable: Atomic assets cannot be altered or tampered with once they have been created. This ensures the integrity and authenticity of the asset.

1. Transferability: Atomic assets can be easily transferred and traded between users on the blockchain. This allows for the quick and efficient exchange of assets.

1. Decentralization: Atomic assets are stored and managed on a decentralized blockchain network, meaning that there is no central authority controlling or regulating the assets.

1. Transparency: Atomic assets are transparent and the ownership and transaction history of the assets can be easily tracked and verified on the blockchain.

1. Security: Atomic assets are built on blockchain technology, which is highly secure, it ensures that assets are protected against fraud and hacking.

## The most important principle is the following

An atomic asset associates one unique identifier, known as a "non-fungible token" (NFT) with the data and smart contract that define the asset. The NFT serves as a digital certificate of authenticity and ownership for the atomic asset, and it is stored on the blockchain.

The data and smart contract associated with the atomic asset define the characteristics and behavior of the asset. For example, the data may include information such as the asset's name, image, and metadata. The smart contract, on the other hand, is a set of programmed rules and conditions that govern how the asset can be bought, sold, and traded on the blockchain.

The combination of the NFT, data, and smart contract creates a unique and verifiable digital asset that can be easily transferred and traded between users on the blockchain. The NFT acts as the proof of ownership and authenticity for the atomic asset, the data provide information about the asset, and the smart contract governs how the asset can be used and traded.
