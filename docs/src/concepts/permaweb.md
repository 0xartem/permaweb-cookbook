# Welcome to the Permaweb

The permaweb is like the web, but permanent. Developers build on top of permaweb services to create sites and applications that will exist forever on arweave.

Benifits of the permaweb.

1. Sites and apps are permanent, you never have to worry about them going away (even if the team supporting them moves on)
1. App developers have to make sure every new version of the app actually adds value, otherwise, why would you switch off the old one.
1. Because all permaweb apps share a common storage layer, Arweave, they can all compose off each others data.
1. Your data is owned by your wallet and can follow you from app to app.
