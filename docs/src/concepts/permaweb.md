# Welcome to the Permaweb

The permaweb is a distribution layer on top of the permanent network arweave. This distribution layer serves data using http primitives to work with any compliant browser on the internet. But there is more, it also provides the ability to query data using GraphQL, an open standard to filter large models of information.

The permaweb is made up of three key service types:

* Gateways
* Bundlers
* Sequencers

These service types reside on top of the Arweave network. Arweave is a fully decentralized storage network, thats core feature is permanent data. Once stored on chain your data is replicated to 1000 of storage systems.
